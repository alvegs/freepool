# freepool

Creating simple browser extension for testing purposes. This is a list that is visible when visiting urls (see usage below). The list is hardcoded after my own needs and this will not be updated or maintained.

## usage

1. clone repo
2. open manifest.json in your browser tab under extensions
3. visit: _://fantasy.premierleague.com/_ - and see the popup.
